## Reflection 

This was a very nice app to Build, it is for everyone who wants to have a better and organised life.
This was a project where I improved my skills working with React, JSX, styled-components, uuid, react-icons, Context API, CSS, JS, local storage etc.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `Context API`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was `Context API`. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into `Context API`.

It was a really nice project to build and I hope you'll like it.
